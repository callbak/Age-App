## Overview
This challenge was a great challenge that require more than html/css/js basic knowledge .
i really enjoyed coding it , from the designing part till the JavaScript part .

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process
1 - Design Process : I worked on HTML/CSS in this part only , i made sure that i finish the design completely and leave the JS part the final one .
2 - JS Process : Started with :
        1- the basic DOM manipulation process . 
    then moved to .     
        2- input fields validation .
    and kept adding things and making solution for the special cases , so at this point , it went from simple to read to a little bit complex .

       
### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript


### What I learned
 - more work with CSS .
 - DOM manipulation .
 - form validation .

### Continued development
 from now on , i will continue developping with HTML&CSS and especially JS .

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - i've found the correct process of calculation in this particular challenge , i built one before but it wasn't that much complete than this one , so i understood this one and used it .
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - helped me with multiple questions , in CSS ans JS Development .
